# Spook In The Jar 23
A Spooky Mod-Jam 2023 entry made by [Laz], Monozari &amp; LastFlareZ.  
Jam-In-The-Jar series entry 1.

# Spooktober 2023: The Carnival.
Due to us starting late in the SpookyJam 2023 event, for the first release we won't be having any big features, but look out for updates!  
The main content is the Jack In The box which is a decoration, but has a big surprise, so be careful when opening it.  
Also some decorations.

# Loader
The mod was designed for Minecraft 1.20.1, on the Forge mod loader platform. No plans to support fabric (Mainly due to my lack of fabric knowledge. -Laz)  
The mod also utilizes the famous GeckoLib for its animations, and is required for running the mod.  
You can install JEI to know more about the recipes the mod has, and further custom jei integration is planned. (Don't know if it will be ready before October 31. -Laz)
## Forge 1.20.1-47.2.1
## Geckolib 1.20.1-4.2.3
## Jei version-dont forget to add -Laz
